# PyLESA

PyLESA stands for Python for Local Energy Systems Analysis and is pronounced "pai-lee-suh".

PyLESA is an open source tool capable of modelling local energy systems containing both electrical and thermal technologies. It was developed with the aim of aiding the design of local energy systems. The focus of the tool is on modelling systems with heat pumps and thermal storage alongside time-of-use electricity tariffs and predictive control strategies. It is anticipated that the tool provides a framework for future development including electrical battery studies and participation in grid balancing mechanisms.

This tool was developed as part of a PhD, "Modelling and Design of Local Energy Systems Incoroporating Heat Pumps, Thermal Storage, Future Electricity Tariffs, and Model Predictive Control " by Andrew Lyden.

PyLESA was written and tested using Python 2.7, and will be soon be converted to be used with Python 3.x
